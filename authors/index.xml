      <description>Hello World! I am a Computer Science graduate from Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur. I started coding in College, being from a non computer background it took time for me to get my interest into it. But by the end of graduation, I started loving it. I have been writing code in golang, clojure and ruby for last three years.
I love reading and discussing about mathematics. I am not a bibliophile, but have recently started reading books and want to make this as a habit.</description>
